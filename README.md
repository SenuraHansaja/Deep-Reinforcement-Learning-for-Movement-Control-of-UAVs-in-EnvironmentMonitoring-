# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Movement Control of UAVs in Environment Monitoring
This is deep reinforcement learning implementation of a research paper mainly based on the Wireless communication
- Objective is to create an agent that can efficiently maximise the coverage area and consume low energy 
- To train the agent Keras-rl is used
